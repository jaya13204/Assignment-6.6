1. Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler

*FIFO Scheduler:

-->A FIFO Scheduler places the applications in a queue and runs them in the order in
 which they were submitted.

-->In FIFO ,requests for the first application in the queue are allocated first and served.Then the
 second application is served and so on.

-->The FIFO scheduler is simple to understand and doesnot need any configurations.

-->The FIFO scheduler has no concept of  priority or size of the job.


*Capacity Scheduler:

-->In capacity scheduler a seperate dedicated queue allows the small job to start as soon 
as it is submitted.

-->The shortest job are assigned and served first followed by the longest one.

-->Capacity scheduler is  most complex and users need know the 
system well to set up configurations.

-->If we are using a large Hadoop cluster, with multiple clients,different types and
 priorities of jobs,then the capacity scheduler will be the valid choice.

2. What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x

--Limitation of Hadoop 1.x:

*It supports only one name node and one namespace per cluster.

*It doesnot support microsoft windows.

*It has  the limitation to serve as platform for event processing, streaming and real time operations.

*It has limited scaling of nodes which is limited to 4000 nodes per cluster

*It has single-point-of-failure because of the single namenode.It requires manual intervention to overcome single
point failure in namenode.

*The namenode failure affects the stack.


--Limitations overcomed by hadoop 2.x:

*It supports multiple namenode servers which  manages multiple namespace.

*It is added with additional features to support microsoft windows.

*It can  serve as a platform for a wide variety of data analytics,making possible to
 run event processing, streaming and real time operation.

*It has better scalability and which can scale up to 10000 nodes per cluster

*It has many advanced features to overcome Single-Point-Of-Failure with a standby Namenode
 and it is configured for automatic recovery in case of namenode failure.

*Hadoop 2.x handles namenode failure using Hive,Pig etc..,
